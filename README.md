# Brian Hu's Personal CV in LaTeX

This CV is based loosely on a LaTeX template from [Jason Blevins' website](http://jblevins.org/projects/cv-template/).

**hucv** is a .bib file with BibTeX entries for each of my publications. This has to be updated manually for new publications.

**myabbrvnat** is a custom .bst file which supports bibliography entries which do not yet have a publication date (e.g. articles that have been submitted, in preparation, etc)
